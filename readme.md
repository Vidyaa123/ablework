# AbleWork

This repository is for the development of an inclusive web app for people with disabilities to connect with employment opportunities.

It is a project for the All-Summer Hackathon for the 1 Million Women to Tech Summer of Code.

All participants in the Summer of Code are invited and welcome to contribute to this project.

A to-do list will be maintained on this trello board: https://trello.com/b/cTUaZP2x
If you would like to see the to-do list, you will need to request to join the team on the board. You can also contact me in the 1 Millon Women to Tech discord if you wish to join the trello board and I will send you an invite.

## The Challenge
People (Vietnamese) with disabilities lack full access to employment opportunities due to societal and cultural norms.


**The due date for this hackathon project is Oct 14, 2018.**
